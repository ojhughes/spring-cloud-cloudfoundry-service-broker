== Introduction
The {osbapi} defines an HTTP interface between the services marketplace of a platform and service brokers. Service Brokers
are responsible for;

* Advertising a catalog of their service offerings and plans
* Acting on requests from the marketplace for
  - provisioning (creating or updating) a service
  - creating a binding between a service and client application
  - unbinding or deleting a binding between a service and client application
  - deprovisioning (deleting) a service

Scaffolding for the broker side of the {osbapi} is implemented by the {scosb} project, by providing the required Spring MVC controllers,
domain objects and configuration. Services authored using {springboot} and {scosb} can easily implement the endpoints
by providing Spring beans that implement the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-service-broker/docs/current/apidocs/[appropriate interface].
