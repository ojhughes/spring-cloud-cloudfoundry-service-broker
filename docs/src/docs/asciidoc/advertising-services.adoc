== Advertising Services
The {osbspec}#catalog-management[brokers catalog] is available to the platform market place via the endpoint `/v2/catalog`

=== Implementing Service Catalogs
The service brokers catalog provides a list of metadata describing the available services along with
attributes such as cost and memory allocation.

The broker can either provide a `@Bean` of type {javadoc}/org/springframework/cloud/servicebroker/model/catalog/Catalog.html[Catalog]
or implement the service {javadoc-services}CatalogService.html[CatalogService]
